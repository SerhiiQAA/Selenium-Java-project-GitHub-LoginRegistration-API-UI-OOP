## UI / API / Performance
OOP is OOP...
JAVA is just made for this. 
At first, it was a bit unusual that everything was strictly structured. One step to the left, one step to the right, and everything is red.  It teaches you discipline!

I created autotests for the UI components of registration and logging, added autotests for the API using Get requests from the main page, and added a load test. Practiced creating classes and methods in JAVA. I also got acquainted with XPath selectors for finding elements. Now I can say that I've joined all the world's test automation tools, including Selenium. I feel as if I've switched from a car with an automatic transmission to a car with manual control) It's a kind of balanced, slow, calm ride when everything is under full control. Of course, calmness is good for reliability. I like this process!
