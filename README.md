OOP is OOP...
JAVA is just made for this. 
At first, it was a bit unusual that everything was strictly structured. One step to the left, one step to the right, and everything is red.  It teaches you discipline!

I practiced creating classes and methods using the example of registration on Github. Also I did a good job with XPath selectors for finding elements. Now I can say that I've joined all the world's test automation tools, including Selenium. I feel like I've switched from a car with an automatic transmission to a car with a manual) It's a kind of balanced, slow, calm ride, when everything is under full control. There's something to this process!
